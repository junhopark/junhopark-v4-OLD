It sure has been a long time since the last time I updated my blog.  Here are the different things that have been occupying me in these last couple of months:

__Work:__ Been busy at work along with the rest of the engineering team as we get ready to launch the next release of our software.  I’ve been able to get my hands on doing a lot of front-end work.  In fact, I would guess that in these last 10 months of working here, I’ve dealt with as much front-end work (Javascript, JSP, HTML, CSS) as I have in all my years prior to joining this company.  The fact that I’ve been able to get my hands on both front and back-end (well, anything “below” the front-end) development has definitely been a major plus of working here.  I can’t wait to see the new features get shipped out to our clients and getting their feedback.

__Ministry:__ I’ve been spending some time helping another brother at church become acclimated with leading worship.  He has a great voice and has been serving in various worship ministry for a number of years, but has never taken the plunge to lead–until now. It’s been such a rewarding experience to say the least.  I believe the church is always in need of faithful servants and likewise, the church is always in need of faithful worship leaders who love the Lord, love people, love music, and are skilled musicians.  It’s been a privilege meeting up with him to help him become the best worship leader that he can be and I have surely been encouraged by his willingness and ability to learn.  There’s no better way to learn than to teach someone and I’m finding that out for myself.  Exciting times for this brother!

__Freelance:__ I started working on a website for a local Japanese restaurant.  For now, I will just say that while I enjoy design work immensely, it is also most definitely challenging.  I’m hoping to get it launched in < 2 weeks.  I’m planning on picking up more of these kinds of gigs.

__Vacation:__ I spent a few days in San Diego with some of my closest friends about a month and a half ago and my gosh, I absolutely *love* this part of the country.  I love the weather, the food (ate a ton of Mexican food), the beaches, and people seem to be a little bit nicer out there.  :)  I have promised myself that I will, one day, live somewhere in California.

__Rest of the Year...:__ I can’t believe there’s less than 3 months left of 2010.  Crazy!  I’m already looking forward to Thanksgiving and Christmas. :)
