I've got a lot to be thankful for.  Here are some that stand out for me:

**Marriage:** When I married my wife almost a year ago, I sincerely believed that I was marrying *the* best girl out there.  Well, I'm glad to admit that I *still* believe that to be true and I could not be anymore thankful to be married to my wife.  Now that I've lived through my first year of marriage, I can't fathom NOT being married.  It's such a horrible thought that I don't want to go anywhere near it.

**Family & Friends:** I'm blessed with some amazing people in my life.  And I love that as a whole, the people that I'm closest to are genuinely good people who love, appreciate, and pursue goodness and godliness.

**My Work:** I love *what* I do, *who* I work with, and I believe in the mission (the *why*) of the company.

Happy Thanksgiving!  I can't wait to eat, eat, and eat some more. :)
