My office moved from Westmont to Chicago about 2 and a half months ago and ever since then I’ve been taking the Metra train to get to work.  There are some things I like about it and some things I don’t like much.

__Things I Like:__

-Energy: I really like the energy of the city.  Everything about the old office (the building itself, its surrounding area, etc.) was just very quiet and near-lifeless.  When you work in a suburb like Westmont, IL, you barely see anybody walking the streets.  Whenever you spot someone walking outside, chances are that the person is getting to/from his/her car.  Not so in the city.  There are people on the train.  There are people out on the streets.  People are chatting outside.  There are people everywhere.  There is life.

-People & Networking: I really like that there are a lot of people I can meet up with & network with right nearby where I work.  I like that user group meetings often take place in the city.

-Walking: I’m sure I won’t be thinking this way when there’s a foot of snow on the ground and it’s negative 10 outside but I have been enjoying the fact that I get to walk a little bit every day.  My walk from the train station to the office is quite short–about 5 minutes each way, which I find to be the perfect amount.

-Being in the city: It’s just plain nice to be in the city.  Chicago really is beautiful.  It sure beats being stuck in a suburb.  I live in an extremely suburban place and it’s very refreshing to get out of it for awhile each day Monday through Friday.


__Things I Don’t Like:__

-Cost: It’s expensive to commute to the city.  My train station is about 8 miles from my place, which costs me gas money as well as normal wear & tear on my car.  And then once I get to the station, I have to pay for parking.  And then of course, I have to pay for the Metra monthly train ticket which costs me $116.10.  That’s a lot of money just to get to and from work.

-Time: It used to take me 25 minutes to get to work.  Now, I have to drive for 15 minutes to get to my station, park, and then walk 3 minutes to get onto the platform.  And of course, I can’t just simply walk into my train right away; I get there about 5 minutes before the train just to be on the safe side.  Then there’s the 32 minute train ride.  Then when the train arrives at the Union station, I have to wait in line to get out of the train and then out of the station, and it takes me about 3 minutes to just get out of the station.  And then finally, there is the 5 minute walk to my office.  25 + 15 + 3 + 5 + 32 + 3 + 5 = __88 minutes__.  I really do not like this at all.  Sure, I can get some useful things done on the train but it is a little challenging.  The train is often noisy & jerky and doesn’t help my concentration.

-Weather: Commuting to work has been a horrible experience when it’s raining a lot outside.  No need to explain that.  One time I forgot my umbrella and I paid a hefty price for my simple mistake.  I’m sure it will be worse when winter comes.  No need to explain that either.

-Lack of flexibility: I have to live and die by the Metra train schedule.  And if I want to go up to the northern suburbs after work (to go see my fiancée, for instance) I have to first take the train all the way down to the western suburbs and then __and then__ take my car back up north.  That’s a lot of wasted time right there.


Driving to work in the suburbs Vs. Taking the train to the city: Which do I like better?  As of now, I can live with both and don’t have any strong preferences for one over the other.  I’m just hoping that this winter won’t be too bad of a winter.
