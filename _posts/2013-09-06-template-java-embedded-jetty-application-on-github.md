I've been meaning to get something up on GitHub and here it is at last:

[https://github.com/junhopark/template-java-embedded-jetty](https://github.com/junhopark/template-java-embedded-jetty)

It's a template application running on Java 1.7 + Embedded Jetty with Twitter Bootstrap 3 & SASS.  I've also included some notes on getting it run with IntelliJ IDEA (see README.md).
