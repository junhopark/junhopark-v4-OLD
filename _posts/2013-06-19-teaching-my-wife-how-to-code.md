My wife recently decided that she wants to learn how to code and of course, I've volunteered to be her teacher.  She has absolutely no experience with programming and I have no experience with teaching someone with zero programming knowledge how to code.  And now that I find myself in this position of attempting to teach her how to code, I'm realizing that I can go about this in so many different ways.  How quickly do I get her to start writing code?  How much background information do I provide her with?  Which language should I choose as her first programming language?  How much should I expect from someone with zero programming knowledge?

All I've promised her is that in 3 months, she'll have an idea as to whether or not she'll want to continue to learn to code.  I'm hoping that in 6 weeks, she'll find herself super curious about all that she's learning but I guess only time will tell.
