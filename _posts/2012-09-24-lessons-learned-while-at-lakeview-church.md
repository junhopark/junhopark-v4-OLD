This coming Sunday will be my last Sunday at Lakeview Church.  I've been a part of this church since summer of 2006 and I've been blessed to experience such a fulfilling 6 years of my life at this church.  Now, as to why my wife and I have decided to leave Lakeview - it really came down to the following 2 reasons: 1. Church (the building) is too far (~1 hour drive each way) 2. Church community (the people) is too far from us.  We wanted to find a church closer to home and be able to invest more of our time, energy, and resources in a church community that's closer to home.

As I look back at my last 6 years at Lakeview, I wanted to jot down a couple of very valuable lessons I've learned:

* Missional heart: I've learned that God is on a mission to save the people of this world and that He wants to use me in accomplishing His mission.  God has called me (and all the other believers) to join Him on this mission in my marriage, in my relationships with others, in my career, and even in my "free" time.  Being a mission-minded Christian means that my "missionary lifestyle" can't be simply limited to when I go on mission trips or am involved with service projects.  My skills, my knowledge, my money, my relationships, and even my weaknesses are to contribute to God's mission.
* Execution of music/worship ministry: One of the main reasons why I decided to join Lakeview back in 2006 is because of their music ministry.  Not only was their music excellent but I could see that there would be a lot of things for me to learn from being involved in this ministry.  I've learned so much in terms of running a music ministry that's in a constant pursuit of glorifying God AND musical excellence.  Much thanks to Herb (worship director at Lakeview) for investing so much of his time and energy in me.  I'm really going to miss serving with Lakeview musicians.

There are obviously a whole bunch of things I've learned during my last 6 years at Lakeview but these 2 are the ones that stand out for me.

Sad to be leaving Lakeview but excited to see what's in store for me and my wife as we look for a new church home.
