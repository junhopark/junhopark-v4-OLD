It’s been about 6 weeks since I started working at [cappex.com](http://www.cappex.com "Cappex.com") and while I’ve been really enjoying the work, I’ve also been guilty of bringing work home.  I’ve often been working on the train, and then turning the computer back on at home and doing some additional work.

Well, I’m gonna put a STOP to that (unless there’s an absolute emergency) and dedicate my post-work-hours time to doing non-work stuff.  Spend more time with my wife, do some more reading, work on my golf swing (I’m quite probably the worst golfer in the world), work on side projects, etc.  The list goes on and on.  I’m betting that ultimately, I’ll be able to get __more__ done at work by __not__ working after work.  I’m thinking that focusing more of my time on other non-work related matters will actually help me maximize my time at the office and get more done.

Let’s see how that goes.
