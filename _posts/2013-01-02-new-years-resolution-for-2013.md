Big things I want to accomplish in 2013:

### Physical

* Meat-less dinners with my wife at least 3 times a week.
* Bench press 225 pounds 5 x 5 with 90 seconds rest.
* Reach body fat of 17%.

### Spiritual

* Find a church.  Commit to it & serve.
* Read through the Bible.

### Relational

* Spend meaningful time with someone besides my wife at least once every 2 weeks.
* Start the adoption process.

### Work

* Build something in Ruby on Rails that I'm proud to show off.
* Start something on the side.
