Thanks to [Plugable](http://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B007L6NYAO/ref=wms_ohs_product?ie=UTF8&psc=1) I've now got 2 monitors hooked up to my Lenovo laptop at work and I'm absolutely **loving it**.  I definitely should've done this way sooner.

Total cost? $64 (Not bad at all!)  And setting it up took all but 5 minutes.  I simply downloaded the latest driver
online from Plugable's website, installed it, plugged in the Plugable device to my laptop as well as to my 3rd
monitor.

Pretty soon, I'll be tempted to go with a 4-monitor setup. :)
