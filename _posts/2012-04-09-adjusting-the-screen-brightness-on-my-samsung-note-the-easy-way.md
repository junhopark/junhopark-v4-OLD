I’ve had my Samsung Galaxy Note for about a month now and I’ve been loving it.  It was a HUGE upgrade over my old phone (Blackberry Bold 9000) and it beats the BlackBerry in __every__ possible way.  Wow, I cannot believe just how much I missed out on by carrying a BlackBerry all these years.  I thought I’d miss the BlackBerry keyboard, but nope, the touchscreen Swype keyboard has served me quite well and can type pretty fast now, almost as fast as I could on my Bold.  Now, many people around me have commented on how ridiculously ginormous they think the phone is and I’ve gotten my fair share of (unwanted) attention and even some scoffing thus far; but, I think the size is just fine.  And it fits quite easily in my jean pockets, just in case you were wondering.  I can sort of maneuver it with one hand but I really don’t think it’s all that important that phones are operable with one hand.  The only time when handling the phone with one hand is useful IMO is when I’m driving and we all know that we shouldn’t be on our phones while we’re driving.  Of course.

Anyhow, I came upon a rather exciting (at least for me) discovery over this past weekend regarding my phone.  I accidentally discovered that I can change the brightness on my phone by touching the very top portion of the screen (the area where you touch and drug (i.e. pull down) to get the Android notifications to show up) and then dragging my finger sideways–left to make the screen dimmer and right to make the screen brighter.  This certainly beats having to go to Settings > Display > Brightness > and then adjusting the screen brightness.

I was thinking about writing a review for the phone sometime.  But then again there are SO many reviews of this phone out on the web and I don’t think I have much to add to the already ongoing discussions.  The important this is that as for me, I love the phone (as previously stated above) and cannot wait for the official Ice Cream Sandwich upgrade.

_NOTE: This easy way of adjusting the screen brightness no longer works after the ICS upgrade._ :(
