<p>For awhile I had been contemplating either deleting my Facebook data or deleting my Facebook account altogether and after reading Christopher Wylie’s book on Cambridge Analytica (Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America) I decided it was finally time to pull the trigger on this. I decided that I’ll delete all of my Facebook data and… perhaps somewhere down the road I’ll decide to delete my Facebook account completely.</p>

<p>This blog post is my attempt at writing a concise guide on how to delete all of your Facebook data (while still keeping your account alive). Note that I did this on facebook.com in Chrome.</p>

<ul>
  <li>
    <p>Go to: <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings &amp; Privacy</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Settings</code> &gt; <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Your Facebook Information</code> &gt; Clicked on <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">View</code> next to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Download Your Information</code> &gt; Decided to download all of my data in both HTML, with <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Media Quality</code> set to <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">High</code>. This triggered an <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Facebook information file requested</code> email and 5 minutes later, I received a <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Your Facebook information file is ready</code> email. When I reloaded the webpage, I was able to click on the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Available Copies</code> link and download the (293.6MB Zip) file that’s been prepared for me. I repeated the same steps for generating a file in JSON (283MB Zip). Once I downloaded the files, I clicked <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Delete</code> for both of the generated files.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I downloaded the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Social Book Post Manager</code> Chrome extension as that appeared to be the best and perhaps the only way to mass-delete my Facebook data.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>It appears that the above Chrome extension only works with the “classic design” Facebook view - which it appears I can only revert to by installing the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Switch to Classic design on Facebook</code> Chrome extension, which I did.</p>
  </li>
  <li>
    <p>I went back to facebook.com &gt; Switched to classic design (by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Switch to Classic design on Facebook</code> extension) &gt; And then by using the <code class="language-plaintext highlighter-rouge">Social Book Post Manager</code> I was able to delete all of my posts.</p>
  </li>
</ul>
