I frequent Hacker News (news.ycombinator.com) pretty often throughout the day and I realized that my eyes were almost always drawn to posts on the first page that had a large number of points.  Sure, I wish I had the time to read through every single one of the posts on the front page, but who has that kind of time?  So I decided to build a single page, super-simple site, which basically grabs the first page of Hacker News and does some simple filtering and sorting by points.

**Here it is: [Hacker News by Points](http://hacker-news-by-points.herokuapp.com/ "Hacker News by Points")**

Just in case you're curious, here's a list of technologies I used to build this:

* [(Unofficial) Hacker News API](http://hndroidapi.appspot.com/)
* [Foundation 4](http://foundation.zurb.com/)
* [Compass + SASS](http://compass-style.org/)
* [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com/)
* [PHP](http://php.net/)
* [IntelliJ IDEA 11](http://www.jetbrains.com/idea/)
