For awhile I had been contemplating either deleting my Facebook data or deleting my Facebook account altogether and after reading Christopher Wylie's book on Cambridge Analytica (Mindf*ck: Cambridge Analytica and the Plot to Break America) I decided it was finally time to pull the trigger on this. I decided that I'll delete all of my Facebook data and... perhaps somewhere down the road I'll decide to delete my Facebook account completely.

This blog post is my attempt at writing a concise guide on how to delete all of your Facebook data (while still keeping your account alive). Note that I did this on facebook.com in Chrome.

* Go to: `Settings & Privacy` > `Settings` > `Your Facebook Information` > Clicked on `View` next to `Download Your Information` > Decided to download all of my data in both HTML, with `Media Quality` set to `High`. This triggered an `Facebook information file requested` email and 5 minutes later, I received a `Your Facebook information file is ready` email. When I reloaded the webpage, I was able to click on the `Available Copies` link and download the (293.6MB Zip) file that's been prepared for me. I repeated the same steps for generating a file in JSON (283MB Zip). Once I downloaded the files, I clicked `Delete` for both of the generated files.

* I downloaded the `Social Book Post Manager` Chrome extension as that appeared to be the best and perhaps the only way to mass-delete my Facebook data.

* It appears that the above Chrome extension only works with the "classic design" Facebook view - which it appears I can only revert to by installing the `Switch to Classic design on Facebook` Chrome extension, which I did.

* I went back to facebook.com > Switched to classic design (by using the `Switch to Classic design on Facebook` extension) > And then by using the `Social Book Post Manager` I was able to delete all of my posts.
