Yet another rendition of [junhopark.com](http://www.junhopark.com/ "junhopark.com") is done… at last!  I decided to forsake my old Blogger posts since it’s been quite awhile since my last blog update and I didn’t want a huge gap showing up on this site between my last blog post and new ones which I’ll be posting (hopefully with some sort of regularity).

I’m glad to finally have something up and running.  I chose to go with WordPress this time around.  We’ll see how much I like this.  So far, I’ve been pretty impressed by it, at least compared to Blogger.

Anyhow, time to sleep.  I promised myself I’d be in bed by 10 pm tonight but...
