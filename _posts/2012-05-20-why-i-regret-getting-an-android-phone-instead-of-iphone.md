I wish I had waited to get the new iPhone (whatever is gonna come after the 4S) instead of picking up the Galaxy Note.

Here are some reasons why I’ve been getting real fed up with the Note.  My guess is that these reasons have to do more with the fact that this is an Android phone (versus the fact that it’s a Samsung phone).

* It seems that _every time_ I update my apps, I am asked to select a “default app” to perform tasks.  For instance, when I want to open up a browser, it asks me if I want to launch the Dolphin browser versus the default browser that was shipped with the phone and it gives me an option to set one as the default browser.  Since most of my apps get regular updates, this is becoming increasingly annoying.  Hey Android – I’ve already told you at least 10 times that I want Dolphin to be set as my default browser.

* UI is not very fluid, especially compared to the iPhone/iPad.  I didn’t think it was going to bother me.   But I was wrong.  C’mon, the hardware is more than capable of giving me a much smoother experience.

* Not only is the UI lacking fluidity, it is often slow.  There are often noticeable delays between when I touch the screen and something actually happens.  Again, annoying.

* Exceptions, exceptions, exceptions: I regularly used the iPad for about a 3 months (until the newness wore off and I really didn’t have a use for it) and I don’t remember any apps ever bombing out on me.  I’ve had this Android phone for just 3 months now and apps explode on me on average once a day.  And this seems to be happening more and more often.

* A number of apps just don’t look right (for instance, texts cut off from the screen).  I guess this is because there is an insane number of different Android phones out there, with various screen sizes and resolutions.
Now, there are obviously some things I do like about Android over iOS–such as better notification system, enhanced customizability, and much easier time transferring files via USB.

I know I wrote last month about just how much I’ve been loving the Note.  However, I’m slowly starting to think that my love for the Note had more to do with my hatred for Blackberry Bold as opposed to actually loving this device/OS.
