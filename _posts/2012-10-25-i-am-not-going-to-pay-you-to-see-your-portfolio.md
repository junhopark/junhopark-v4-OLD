Earlier today, I had a web design candidate who informed us that he would be able to provide us with an up-to-date portfolio of his design work **for a flat fee**.

***Um, what?***

This guy wanted us to pay him so that he can work on putting something together nicer than what he had originally submitted to us.

I have no clue what this guy was thinking, but I certainly have never heard of interview candidates who offer to present a sample of their work for a fee.  I sincerely hope that no one will ever pay him just to take a look at his portfolio.

Interviewing/screening can be so fun sometimes.
