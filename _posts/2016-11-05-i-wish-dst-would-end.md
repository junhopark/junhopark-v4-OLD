I really wish Daylight Savings Time would cease to exist.  I can't possibly imagine that DST would go away in my lifetime due to the sheer complexities and costs involved with it but a man can dream. Thanks to DST, there are 2 times every year where I'm worried that some program or system that I'm responsible for would go rogue on me due to the sudden shift in time.  Just the other day at work, I had to go through every single cron job in our system and verify that nothing horrible would go wrong due to the fact that every second between 1 AM until 1:59 AM will repeat itself or the fact that 2 AM and every second thereafter will take place an hour later than what we've been accustomed to since March 13th of this year.  I already know that I'm going to be sort of on edge tomorrow because despite all of my due diligence, there's an elevated risk of some program behaving in a way that I did not expect due to the time change.  I hate that twice every single year (and most likely for the rest of my life), I even have to worry or talk about what happens when the clock suddenly shifts by an hour.  I'm busy, I already have a lot on my mind, and worrying about time shifting on me is the last thing I would like to worry about.

I'm not crazy about the fact that my 2-year old son who already wakes up too early for my liking will now wake up an hour earlier.  Some of my friends on Facebook are celebrating the extra hour of sleep they'll be getting tonight and it's too bad that I won't be able to join in on their celebration.

I'm worried that the alarm on my phone won't go off tomorrow at the expected time.  Can I be 100% sure that the time shift will occur when it's supposed to and that when the alarm goes off at 6 AM, it won't actually be 7 AM?  I've gone through this routine dozens of times now but it still has me worried.

I hate that it's going to be pitch black by the time I come home from work.  I know, without DST I would not have enjoyed the "extra daylight" anyway.  But I think the loss of 1 hour of daylight during the evening hours is more painful when it's suddenly taken away from me over the course of a single 24-hour period.

Can a 2020 presidential candidate promise to end Daylight Savings Time, please?  This would greatly increase the likelihood that I would vote for you.
