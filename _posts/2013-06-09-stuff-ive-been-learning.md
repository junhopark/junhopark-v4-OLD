It's been quite awhile since my last blog post and I had a sudden itch to write about things I've been learning (mostly at/through work) over the course of, say, the last 6 months.

### Interviewing
I've reviewed a ton of resumes and have conducted a lot of interviews over the course of my last 11 months at Cappex.  Some interesting things I've learned or realized:

* When it comes to interviewing developers, nothing beats in-person coding tests in terms of weeding out bad candidates.
* It's really difficult to give high marks to candidates who aren't able to communicate very well.  They could be absolutely brilliant and be the most productive coder ever; however, if he/she can't communicate very well, chances are, my colleagues and I are probably not going to enjoy working with the person very much.
* Claiming to know something you don't know will pretty much guarantee that you will not get the position.
* 2-3 page resumes are the best when it comes to mid-to-senior level candidates.
* Post-interview thank-you emails are helpful.  But only if it's kept brief.  Otherwise, it just comes off as being desperate.
* When assessing candidates prior to interviewing them, I've learned to make sure to not only review their resume but also to look them up on the web (Google, LinkedIn, Facebook, Twitter, blog, etc).  It's too risky NOT to do that.
* I've started conducting some in-person coding tests while allowing the candidates to use Google (for API lookups and what not) and it's been really interesting to observe what people type into Google.  If I ask you to "Do X, Y, and Z" typing "how to do X, Y, and Z" into Google will make you look *really* bad.

### Technical matters
* I've been doing most of my coding using jQuery & Spring.  Both of them are a joy to work with.
* JSON > XML.
* Git is better than Subversion.
* IntelliJ IDEA is way better than Eclipse.  I never want to code in Eclipse & probably wouldn't take a job if I was forced to code in Eclipse.  (While I've been using IntelliJ for a few years now, I'm only making this statement since I had to do a bit of work in Eclipse a few months ago)
* Toad for MySQL is a horrible piece of junk that's only acceptable because it's free.
* Sublime Text is the best plain text editor.
* Having to support 2 different JavaScript frameworks in a single code base (MooTools being the other) just plain sucks.
* Apple products just work.  Windows & Android products - not so much. And I'm most definitely NOT an Apple fanboy. (I have an Android phone and didn't own a Mac until last year)

### Misc.
* I've really come to appreciate working with people who are both smart AND nice.  I would take smart + nice any day over experienced + cocky or genius + egotistical.
