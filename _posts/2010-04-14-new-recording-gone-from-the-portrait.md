Over the weekend I started re-recording a song which I had written a few years back.  Vocals, acoustic guitar, electric guitars, bass, keyboards, drums-via-keyboard all recorded in my room.

Here it is: [Gone from the Portrait](http://soundcloud.com/junhopark/gone-from-the-portrait "Gone From the Portrait")

So, a quick blurb about the song–it’s a goodbye song I wrote in response to a friend who was going away and I just remember having repeated thoughts of _man, I really wish I had gotten to know this person better... it’s all too late now..._

A good reminder to invest in relationships that really matter.
