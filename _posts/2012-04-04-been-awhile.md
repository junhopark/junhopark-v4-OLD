The last time I wrote in this thing was 10/22 of last year, which is also the time when wedding preparations got crazy. Well, thank God the wedding is now over (_what an amazing experience!_), honeymoon in South Africa was incredibly memorable, and now it’s April of 2012. The sad thing is that there are still wedding-related tasks that need to get done–such as writing thank you cards and putting together our wedding photo albums. Ugh. Not really looking forward to it to be honest, but I know it’s gonna feel SO good when all of that is completely over with.  Married life, by the way, is pretty darn sweet.

Now that things have settled down (finally) I’ve slowly been able to spend time working on a few different design/coding related things and spend plenty of time playing around with my new phone/tablet aka Samsung Note.  Slowly getting used to the different comments & funny looks (even from complete strangers) I’ve been getting whenever I pull out the phone.

Hopefully I’ll have more things to write in here in the coming months.  Until then.
