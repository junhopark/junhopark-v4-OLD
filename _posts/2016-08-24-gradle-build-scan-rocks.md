Earlier today I attend a [webinar](http://www2.gradle.com/l/68052/2016-08-02/86lgn7) hosted by Gradle, Inc. where **Gradle Build Scan** was introduced.  If you're already using Gradle as the build tool for your project, setting up Gradle Build Scan will take you no more than 2 minutes.  All I had to do was to follow the steps outlined in [https://scans.gradle.com/setup/step-1](https://scans.gradle.com/setup/step-1), which involves opening up your *build.gradle* file and adding the following at the top:

    plugins {
        id 'com.gradle.build-scan' version '1.0'
    }

    buildScan {
        licenseAgreementUrl = 'https://gradle.com/terms-of-service'
        licenseAgree = 'yes'
    }

I then ran my Gradle "build" task and had to append "-Dscan" at the end, like this:

    jpark:hellooo-world jpark$ ./gradlew build -Dscan

As the Gradle task was completing, I could see that the Gradle Build Scans tool was posting the results to a uniquely generated URL.  I ran the above command several times and here's a URL that was generated: [https://scans.gradle.com/s/cl7czl4ezvnta](https://scans.gradle.com/s/cl7czl4ezvnta)

When I went to the URL, it showed me the following information:

* Console output from when the Gradle task was executed
* Metrics on build performance as well as suggestions on how to make the build faster
* Which Gradle tasks were executed
* Information on dependencies
* Information on Gradle plugins used
* Infrastructure-related information on where the Gradle task was run (such as the version of Java, OS, # of CPU cores)

**VERY COOL!**

What I like:

* Super easy to implement if you're already using Gradle.  It could not be any easier!
* The results page that's generated by the tool is very helpful and beautiful to look at, IMO.
* The most recent update to the [Jenkins Gradle Plugin](https://wiki.jenkins-ci.org/display/JENKINS/Gradle+Plugin) supports Gradle Build Scans. According to the page: "If a Gradle Build Scan is produced during the build then a link is added to the build page."
* The uniquely generated pages will live FOREVER (according to [Mark Vieira](https://gradle.org/author/mark/) who presented the webinar).

What I don't like:

* There should be some way to be able to control who can access the results page.  I'm not yet 100% sure that I feel confident about using Gradle Build Scans at Cappex.com for this reason.  FYI as it relates to this bullet point - at the webinar, the presenter informed us that there is a enterprise-level on-premise option that could be implemented.
* It's great that the results pages live forever; however, it would be even better if there was a way to permanently delete them.

Despite the negatives, this is looking like an amazingly useful tool and I can't wait to dig deeper into it and hopefully start using it at Cappex.com.

QUICK UPDATE (8/25/2016): Here are the links to the webinar [slides](http://www2.gradle.com/e/68052/ty-with-Gradle-Build-Scans-pdf/8kdyjc/210367212) and the [recording](http://www2.gradle.com/e/68052/v-LBiz8FX3Nf8-feature-youtu-be/8kdyjf/210367212).
