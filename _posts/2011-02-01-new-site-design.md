I’ve been wanting to convert my site to a single-page design and after working on this on & off for the last several weeks, I’m glad to have the site finally d-o-n-e.

It’s mostly made up of Google Web Fonts and free icons I found on the web, with a tiny bit of touch-up jobs on some of the images using GIMP.  And coded in Eclipse.  Thank God for free software.

And lastly, I waved goodbye to RimuHosting and said hello to [LithiumHosting](http://www.lithiumhosting.com "Lithium Hosting").  I’ll have to wait and see just how reliable their service is but I found their $10/year for 1.5 GB storage & 30 GB of monthly bandwidth such a g-r-e-a-t deal.  I don’t remember coming across anything better.  I really liked RimuHosting (they have an amazing support system in place, IMO) but for the amount of time I (do not) spend tinkering around on their server, I couldn’t justify shelling out what I’ve been paying them.

Well, as always, if you have any feedback regarding the new site I would LOVE to hear from you!
