A few days ago, I phone screened a QA Manager candidate that ended up being extremely memorable.  It went something like this:

About 10 minutes into the phone screen, I started asking him some (very basic) technical questions.  I thought I'd start quizzing him on his database knowledge since 1) It's a requirement for the job (as cleared stated in the job post) and 2) He claims to know a thing or two about relational databases on his resume.

Question 1: I asked him for a simple select statement.  No joins, no group by, nothing complicated at all.  He fumbled quite a bit on it.

Question 2: I asked him another simple database-related question.  I'm not going to say on here what the exact question was, but trust me--it was something really simple.  It should've taken him < 5 seconds to answer me.  If you've worked with relational databases in the past, you should know the answer to this question.  When I asked him the question, his initial reply was "yes".  I then asked him to tell me what he knows about it.  He then claimed to tell me he knows the answer and that he has a MS degree.

Interesting.  I've neve gotten such a response from an interviewee in the past.

I told him that I wanted him to explain.  And this is when things started getting really interesting.  He told me that this is a "school type" of question and that I shouldn't ask such a question to a senior-level interview candidate.

Wow.  I kept my cool and told him that while I understand what he's trying to tell me, I still needed him to give me the answer because I need to know whether or not he can do the job.  And sure enough, he got even more upset and went on and on about how I should be conducting my interviews.

No one has ever told me how to conduct interviews *during* an interview.

Conversation over.  We hung up.  And to my surprise (I shoudn't have been surprised, though), this guy sent me an angry email.  I really wish I could paste the contents of the email here.  It was completely unprofessional and written in a very badly broken English to top it off.  It was actually pretty funny to read.

After this fiasco took place, I was on my way home from work and thought long and hard about the whole exchange.  I asked myself if there was anything I could've done differently.  Was any of this my fault?

The conclusion I came to was that nope, none of this is my fault and there's not a thing I should change about how I phone screen people.  I'm not saying that my phone screen methods are perfect.  I'm just saying that there was no redeeming lesson that I could've taken away from having talked to this candidate.  He certainly could've responded to my question in a variety of different (better) ways.

* He could've told me "No, I don't know the answer."
* He could've asked for a hint.
* He could've made up an answer.
* He could've gotten upset but could've kept it to himself.
* He could've told me he's got a problem with me asking such a question and bring it up in a professional manner.

But nope, instead, he did some of the absolute worst things he could as an interviwee.  He lied (about knowing the answer), he refused to answer a perfectly valid question, he got angry at the interviewer, and told the interviewer how to conduct interviews.

Well, at least I had a good laugh about it.
