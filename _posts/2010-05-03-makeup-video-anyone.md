This has got to be the most unique use of my music to date in my quasi music career:

[YouTube video featuring my music](http://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JJ1vWWpaQW0&w=580&h=360 "YouTube")

If you're not in the mood to watch the video, it's an instructional makeup video.  :)  I met her ([Hanh Bui](http://www.youtube.com/user/ahanhbarbie34 "Hanh Bui")) at [Kollaboration](http://www.kollaboration.org "Kollaboration"),  which is an annual/semi-annual Asian-American talent competition show which I performed at 2 weekends ago.  She was one of the judges at the show.  Here's a true YouTube celebrity with about 80,000 subscribers and over 2.8 million views of her videos.  Those are some crazy numbers, if you ask me.

While I'm not into wearing makeups, I'm at least a little bit flattered by the use of my music in her video.

2 rather brief blog posts in a row--I promise the next one will be much longer.
