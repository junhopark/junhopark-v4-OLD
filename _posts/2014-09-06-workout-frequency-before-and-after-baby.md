Ever since my son was born in late June, it's been a challenge trying to find time to work out. Since I record every one of my workout sessions, I thought I'd take a few minutes to jot down what my workout frequency has been, before Vs. after the baby.  Here are the results:

## Before the baby (First 26 weeks in 2014)
* 103 total workouts.
* Average of 3.96 workouts per week.  Of these...
	* 33.94% have been upper body workouts
	* 12.84% have been lower body workouts
	* 53.21% have been cardio workouts

## After the baby (Last 10 weeks)
* 24 total workouts.
* Average of 2.4 workouts per week.  Of these...
	* 43.33% have been upper body workouts
	* 13.33% have been lower body workouts
	* 43.33% have been cardio workouts
