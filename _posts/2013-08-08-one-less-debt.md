Just paid off my student loans, which took me about 9 years and 3 months.  I was planning on letting it drag on and
on because of the super low interest on it (< 2%) but after a bit of prodding from the wife,
I thought I'd go ahead and just pay it off.

**It feels good already.**

Now down one single (ginormous) debt--my mortgage.
