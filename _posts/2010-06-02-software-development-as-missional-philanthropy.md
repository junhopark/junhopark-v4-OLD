For some time now I’ve been really interested in going overseas for the purposes of doing missional philanthropic work.  And by “missional philanthropy” I am specifically including the following 2 components:

1. Vocational Training: In my case, I’d like to teach software development–anything from teaching students how to write programs consisting of nothing more than simple algebraic expressions all the way to full-blown applications that people can utilize to solve everyday problems.  This will be my focus in this blog post.

2. Gospel: Proclaiming the great news of the Gospel–perhaps most eloquently summarized in [john 3:16](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/John_3_16 "John 3:16")–primarily through music, preaching, and the sharing of testimonies.

My reasons for wanting to teach software development in this context are numerous but in a nutshell, it is as follows:  While I, like most people around me, can get sometimes get into the habit of complaining about the things that I do not have in my life, when it’s all said and done I have been blessed with so much and perhaps more importantly, with so much to give.  I’ve been blessed with a good education, a  job that I enjoy, and in software development a skill set that is not only valuable in today’s marketplace but one that will only grow in its demands in the foreseeable future.  I would love to be able to share this skill set with those who may not be fortunate enough to have even the opportunity to learn this truly enjoyable (at least for some) and valuable skill set.

I am in a completely brainstorming mode here, but this is what I’ve been thinking of as it relates to actually carrying out this little dream of mine:

* Funds and Materials Needed: Plane tickets.  Lodging.  Room/building rentals to hold classes in.  Teaching materials.  Student materials (such as notebooks, writing utensils, etc).  Food for the students and myself (as well as any others who may join me).  LCD Projector.  Laptops/Netbooks (to be given away to students at the conclusion of the trip).  Backpacks.

* Fund Raiser: While I’d most definitely be willing to spend my own money to carry out this task, since I’m not looking to make even a single penny off of this endeavor, I think it would be perfectly right to attempt to raise all of the necessary funds through various fundraising activities.  I’m thinking some kind of a benefit concert/coffee house.  Musical skills can come in handy at times.

* Duration: 2 weeks.  I’d need to use my own vacation time to do this, which means it can’t be too long.  Once I arrive at my destination, classes would run from morning until early evening with free lunch and dinner.  Night time activities would consist of music as well as various forms of gospel proclamations.

__QUESTIONS:__

Here are some questions I have floating around in my head:

* Location? Where to?  To make the trip as cost efficient as possible, I’d like to stay as close home as possible.  Somewhere between the western edges of North America and eastern edges South America seems like a good candidate.  Haiti is one of the countries I’ve been thinking of, but I’m sure there would be plenty of other good candidates as well.

* Why overseas? To be honest, I’m not so sure I can answer this clearly.  I know that there are despicably impoverished places in my own country.  Not having to travel overseas would mean that the trip would be cheaper.  It would certainly be more convenient as my money, language, appliances, and cellphone would all work just fine.  I think when it comes down to it, though, wanting to go overseas is more of a personal, perhaps somewhat selfish motive of mine.  I feel that by traveling overseas to carry out this task, it would somehow enrich my experience and help me attain a better  understanding of what it’s like to do missional philanthropic work.

* The Gospel? Do I need to include the Gospel?  There’s a part of me that would prefer that this missional philanthropic endeavor simply be a philanthropic endeavor.  It would be easier.  I wouldn’t have to deal with anyone accusing me of carrying out some sort of a bait and switch scheme or a feeble attempt at proselytization.  And while I do not think it would be wrong for me to not include the Gospel (and am slightly open to the idea) I am a bit disturbed by the fact that if my purpose is to go help people why not go the extra mile and share with the people what is most helpful?  More helpful than knowing how to write code… more helpful than any practical skill set one can attain… something they can have and hold onto when they have absolutely nothing to hold onto?

* Why not simply give $$?  Why not work harder, make more money, and give to the expert philanthropists who are already involved in doing this sort of work?  Perhaps wanting to carry out this endeavor myself stems from somewhat of a selfish motive… however, I think most people will agree with me that giving money can get, well, a little bit boring.  I want to get my own two hands dirty in this kind of experience if I have the opportunity to do so.  Being able to carrying out this kind of task from start to end is a thrill that I only hope I will get to experience sooner than later.

This is all I have to say for now.  I would most certainly welcome your feedback either via this website, Twitter, Facebook, or email!  If, by any chance, you are even remotely interested in partnering up with me on this in any sort of capacity, please do let me know.
