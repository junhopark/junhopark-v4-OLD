So... I’m scrounging around the internet looking for some TDD-related tidbits and I came across the following at [www.artima.com](http://www.artimar.com "The Artimar Developer Community").

## If you write code, write tests

The pupil asked the master programmer:

“When can I stop writing tests?”

The master answered:

“When you stop writing code.”

The pupil asked:

“When do I stop writing code?”

The master answered:

“When you become a manager.”

The pupil trembled and asked:

“When do I become a manager?”

The master answered:

“When you stop writing tests.”

The pupil rushed to write some tests. He left skid marks.

If the code deserves to be written, it deserves to have tests.
