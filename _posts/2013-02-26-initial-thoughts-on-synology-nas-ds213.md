I purchased a Synology NAS DS213 last week and here are my thoughts after using this device for about a week now:

### Why NAS?
I wanted my wife and I to be able to easily share files with each other without having to upload files into "the cloud", such as Dropbox.  While I do love Dropbox for its convenience, I'm weary when it comes to storing my private data in the Dropbox cloud.

### Why Synology DS213?
I decided on a 2-bay model since my wife and I don't have a ton of data and I thought that having 2 x 3TB drives would last us for quite awhile.  DS213 seemed like the perfect choice for an entry-level 2-bay NAS.  After a week of playing around with it, I'm convinced that I got myself the right NAS & am glad I didn't go for a more expensive option.

### Details on my purchase
* Synology DS213 ($299.99 on Amazon)
* WD Red 3TB NAS Hard Drive ($162.99 on Amazon)


### The Good
* **Super easy to set up.**  I unpacked DS213 & the hard drive (1 minute), plugged the hard drive into DS213 (1 minute), hooked it up to my router (seconds), and when I went to http://find.synology.com on my Mac, it found DS213 right away.  Completely brainless and easy.
* **Amazing admin console.** The admin console (accessible via web browsers) is fast and easy-to-use.  It's quite impressive considering that I'm accessing the admin console inside of a web browser.
* **Useful mobile apps.** There are a number of useful Synology mobile apps, such as file explorer, audio player, video player, and photo viewer.  Apps are Android and iOS compatible.

### The Bad
* **Photo feature = unusable.** When you upload pictures to the 'photo' shared folder, Synology attempts to create a thumbnail for each image, which is a PAINFULLY slow process and causes the CPU usage to climb to 100%.  Try googling 'synology photo thumbnail slow'.  I spent a good hour Googling for a workaround.  I decided to not use the Synology-supported photo feature and instead.  Not the end of the world, but it is rather unfortunate.
* **Router set up.** While this isn't a huge deal, it is worth mentioning.  Since my router is not supported by EZ-Internet ([Click here](http://www.synology.com/support/router.php?lang=us)), I had to manually set up port forwarding in order for me to access my NAS from outside of home network.

### Final thoughts
Despite the photo feature being unusable, it's $462.98 well-spent.  Highly recommended.
